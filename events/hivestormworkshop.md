The cybersecurity club is ready to host our first workshop! This workshop is a great opportunity to learn the basics of computer that you will need to compete in Hivestorm.

This is also a great opportunity to see our cyber range at the BRIC! It's an incredible space and worth going out to see.

This workshop will mostly be geared towards new cybersecurity members with little knowledge of Linux and Windows and those competing in Hivestorm. Come with materials to take notes and be prepared to learn!

The event is Tue. Oct. 3rd at the Baylor Research Innovation Collaborative (BRIC). We'll have further instructions on how to get in on the day of.
